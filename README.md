# 📚 BookTracker

**BookTracker** is a simple iOS app built using **SwiftUI** and **Core Data**. It showcases how to build a modern iOS app that performs full **CRUD operations** with persistent local storage, image handling, filtering, and search — all using SwiftUI's declarative UI.

This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate real-world usage of **Core Data with SwiftUI**.
